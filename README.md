This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Available Scripts

Don't forget to run `npm install` before using the following...

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## NOTES
This project was completed in under 2.5 hours. Hopefully, the project folder structure is very easy to follow. 

Each component is documented and writtent in ES6. There are 0 node modules leveraged to complete this task, just React and 'vanilla' JS! Check out that package.json son! 

By leveraging react scripts this project benefits from having a wonderful out of the box WebPack configuration, built in css prefixing, testing capabilities and a very light overhead.

There are a few corners cut to complete this task inside the timeframe set, but they are commented, and hopefully the more polished solution is clearly visible. Specifically, this app has no pagination, which with the GIFy api is super easy, so I skipped it to save time. 

I had a blast doing this, and I hope you like it! My comments could have used more humor, sorry ;)
